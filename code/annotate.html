            We are a research group conducting a study on the subjectivity of human skin tone annotations. In this task, you will be asked
            to <strong>annotate your skin tone and the skin tone of others by ranking an icon and images (respectively) on a scale</strong>
            using the interface we provide. Below is a brief overview of the tasks in this experiment:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We will first collect your consent for participation and then
              present a brief tutorial on how to use the tool.
            </li>
            <li>
              You will then be asked to identify your own skin tone along the given scale.
            </li>
            <li>
              Following this, you will be presented with a series of six (6) images of human subjects.
            </li>
            <li>
              For each item, you will be asked to place it onto the scale based on the the human subject’s overall skin tone (predominant complexion) by first finding the lightest tone where the subject may be placed on the scale followed by finding the darkest tone where the subject can be placed.
            </li>
          </ul>

            participation in study:
          </p>
          <p class="box">
            This task involves the self-identification of skin tone, as well as the annotation of medical images of infected skin. There may be discomfort in providing personal information such as perceived skin tone and viewing medical images may be discomforting or stressful. Given the historical harm of classifying skin tone and other phenotypical features related to race or ethnicity, the annotation task may cause momentary discomfort. We do not anticipate further risks.

          <h1>Annotation Tutorial</h1>
          <p>
            In this training example, we will guide you through the process
            of annotating the skin tone of a single example. In this example case, we will
            be placing a photo of a person on a scale based on your estimate
            of their <strong>predominant skin tone</strong>. Since there is always some
            uncertainty in the apparent skin tone of a person in a photo (lighting, clarity of photo, etc.), we will instead annotate the picture
            by <strong>finding the upper and lower bounds</strong> of the image subject's skin tone
            using skin tone color swatches as reference. Example images of people will also be placed along the scale for you to compare with the given image.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Note</strong>: Please disable any display brightness/color adjustment software, remove any color-adjusting screen protectors and adjust the brightness level to what is comfortable for you to clearly see the images and scale. These measures will ensure a more consistent environment for viewing the skin tone of image subjects.

          <div id="training-step-0-dl" class="subpage">
            <h2>Step 1: Find lower tone bound</h2>
            <p>
              For this step we're trying to find the lower bound of the image subject’s skin tone.
              This means we want to find out the <i>darkest</i> position the person
              can be placed on the scale. Using the slider below, compare the current
              photo against the existing skin tone types on the scale.

                Scroll the slider handle from <strong>left to right</strong>.
                Compare the current photo to the skin tone swatches on its left and right as
                you're sliding the handle. Use the examples underneath the slider
                to quickly skip over areas
              </p>
              <p>
                Position the slider so that you're confident the photo to the
                <strong>left</strong> shows someone who is <strong>definitely
                darker</strong>, while the photo to the <strong>right</strong>
                is <strong>lighter</strong> (can be similar in skin tone or lighter).

              Great! Now it's time to find the upper bound. This means we
              want to find out the <i>lightest</i> place the person can be placed on the scale.
              Notice that the position for the lower bound (that we just
              annotated) has been fixed in place. Like before, move the slider
              handle for the upper bound to compare the current photo against

                the <strong>left</strong> is <strong>darker</strong> (can
                be similar skin tone or darker).

              The blue shaded range indicates the skin tone range of the current

              For this step we're trying to find the lower bound of the image subject’s skin tone.
              This means we want to identify the <i>darkest</i> position the person
              can be placed on the scale. Using the slider below, compare the current
              photo against the existing skin tone types and example images on the scale.

                Compare the current photo to the example images on its left and right as
                you're sliding the handle. Use the skin tone swatches underneath the slider
                to quickly skip over areas.

              Great! Now it's time to find the upper bound. This means we
              want to identify the <i>lightest</i> place the person can be placed on the scale.
              Notice that the position for the lower bound (that we just
